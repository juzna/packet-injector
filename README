What is it?
  Just having fun with node.js, learning. Aim is to create packet decoder and creator and then sniff data from network and inject new packets.
  Motivation: Inject malformed packets to see, how the network will responsd


Principles:
 This app consits of two parts:
   - server - written in C, listens on ethernet interface (or wifi card)
   - client - written in JS, connects to server via TCP. Uses server to access ethernet or wifi card 
 For communication is used simplified aircrack protocol (will change in future versions)


Prerequisities:
 node.js
 node_pcap


File list:
- tools.js - common tools, packet decoder and creator
- arp.js - simple test of ARP packet
- client.js - connect's to updated airserv and send/receives packets
